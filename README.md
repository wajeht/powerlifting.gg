# üßê Why?

Yo, ever tried finding a solid coach on Insta? It's like sifting through a jungle. We're here to cut through the noise and give you the real deal. Our site's all about hooking you up with legit reviews and comparisons so you can pick the perfect coach, while also keeping them in check, you feel me?

# ü§î Technical Why?

`JavaScript` ain't as bad as some folks make it out to be. Most devs ~~(You have skill issues)~~ just need to up their game and get better at it, you know? Check out this slick multi-tenancy app we whipped up, with each tenant rocking its own subdomain.

Pretty sweet, huh?

We're rocking classic `server-side` rendering, but spicing things up with Vue on the client side where it really shines. And we're not holding back on the tools either `Tailwind`, `Vitest`, `Playwright`, you name it. Sky's the limit!

You might be asking: why not use `Next`, `Nuxt`, or some other `meta-framework`? This project seems like a hack and blah blah blah.

SHUT UP!

This project ain't no hack job. It's `clean`, it's `scalable`, it's `testable` and guess what? No black magic under the hood. So zip it, haters!
