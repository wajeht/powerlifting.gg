# 🤔 Why?

`JavaScript` does not suck. Most developers suck at writing `JavaScript`. Here is a very simple multi-tenancy application with each tenant operating with its own subdomain.

How cool is that? I'd say it is pretty cool!

We're using traditional server-side rendering with `Vue` as a client on some parts of the apps where it makes complete sense! With a combination of modern tools like `Tailwind`, `Vitest`, `Playwright`, and more, your imagination is the limit.

You might be asking: why not use `Next`, `Nuxt`, or some other `meta-framework`? This project seems like a hack and blah blah blah.

SHUT UP!!"
