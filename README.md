multitenancy coaching review systems

> [!WARNING]
> This project is unfinished and heavily work in progress.

# 🤔 Why?

`JavaScript` does not suck. Most developers ~~(You)~~ have skill issues and suck at writing `JavaScript`. Here is a very simple multi-tenancy application with each tenant operating with its own subdomain.

How cool is that? I'd say it is pretty cool!

We're using traditional server-side rendering with `Vue` as a client on some parts of the app where it makes complete sense and needs extensive interactivity. With a combination of modern tools like `Tailwind`, `Vitest`, `Playwright`, and more, your imagination is the limit.

You might be asking: why not use `Next`, `Nuxt`, or some other `meta-framework`? This project seems like a hack and blah blah blah.

SHUT UP!

This whole codebase is `readable`, `extensible`, `testable`, and lastly, there is no damn `MAGIC` under the hood!
